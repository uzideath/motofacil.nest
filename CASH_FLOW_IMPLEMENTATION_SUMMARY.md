## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ JWT authentication required on all endpoints
- ✅ Role-based access control (ADMIN, MODERATOR, USER)
- ✅ User tracking (createdById on all records)
- ✅ Route guards with permission decorators
- ✅ Input validation with class-validator
- ✅ Idempotency protection against duplicates
- ✅ Audit trail via createdAt/updatedAt

---

## 💡 Key Technical Features

### Idempotency
All create operations use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate transactions, even if the same request is sent multiple times.

### Transaction Safety
Database transactions ensure atomic operations for transfers (two transactions + transfer record + balance updates all succeed or all fail).

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic database indexes
- Pagination on all list endpoints
- Balance caching on accounts
- Efficient query patterns

### Multi-Currency Support
- Currency field on all monetary records
- Exchange rate validation
- Automatic conversion warnings

### Extensibility
- Custom metadata JSON fields
- Tags for flexible categorization
- Attachment URL arrays
- Generic rule engine

  category: 'LOAN_REPAYMENT_RECEIVED',
  amount: installment.amount,
  metadata: { loanId, installmentId }
});
```

**Expenses → Cash Flow**
```typescript
// Record expense
cashFlowService.create({
  idempotencyKey: `expense-${expenseId}`,
  category: mapCategory(expense.category),
  amount: expense.amount,
  metadata: { expenseId, providerId }
});
```

**Cash Register → Cash Flow**
```typescript
// Record cash register closing
cashFlowService.create({
  idempotencyKey: `register-${closingId}`,
  amount: totalCash,
  metadata: { closingId, providerId }
});
```
